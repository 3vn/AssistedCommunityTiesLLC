    <div>Welcome and thank you for your interest in our organization, Assisted Community Ties! We have built a network of really solid individuals who put so much dedication, love and care into the people we serve. We are comprised of 13(and counting) young, fun, loving individuals serving over 60 people with special needs. At ACT we provide 1:1 care so that each of our customers has the ability to focus on their own goals and interests as well as have full attention and support from their provider. The staff  uses a group message service throughout each weekday to communicate our activity plans to invite each other and form groups of participants. This gives our customers the ability to make friends, work on social norms, and build communication skills. This dynamic also comes in handy when a customer wants to choose an activity that is different than the activities that the group is doing. 

At Assisted Community Ties, we specialize in activity services but can also provide services in living supports, respite care, and support with volunteer positions. We have a great amount of knowledge about the many different activities that our community offers and are always looking for new ideas for our customers to experience. Our staff has memberships to the zoo and OMSI so our clients can participate in those activities at no cost to them. Occasionally, the Portland Trail Blazers donate tickets to our organization which gives us the ability to take our clients there for free from time to time. Weâ€™re very knowledgeable about the establishments that give discounts for people with disabilities and which places offer the best deals. 

Examples of activities we provide are:

Bowling
Oregon Zoo
OMSI
Portland Aquarium
Movie Theaters
Play Pool
Board Games
Arcades
Miniature Golf
Go-Karts
Laser Tag
Shopping Malls
Libraries
Arts and Crafts
