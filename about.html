	 <h1 id="blurb">Community Inclusion Support</h1>
     <p>We specialize in providing
community inclusion supports and
have been providing services since
2006. We have a great amount of
knowledge about the many different
activities that our community offers
and are always looking for new
ideas for our customers to
experience.</p>
     <p>In order to help customers save
money in the community, we have
memberships to the Oregon Zoo
and OMSI which allow us to bring
our customers at no cost to them.
Weâ€™re also knowledgeable about
the establishments that give
discounts for people with
disabilities and which places offer
the best deals.</p>
     <p>We also stock our vehicles with
equipment to be prepared for
activities like board games, sporting
equipment, and art supplies.</p>

	 <h1 id="blurb">Group Oriented</h1>
	 <p>Our team consists of ten providers and often we plan
group activities which give our customers the
opportunity to meet and socialize with their peers. We
have seen many great relationships form and blossom
out of our group activities over the years. </p>
	 <p>Every weekday our providers coordinate with each
other and come up with different activity ideas in
order to plan group activities and give our customer
different options. They can choose to do activities
independently with their provider or in a group. </p>
